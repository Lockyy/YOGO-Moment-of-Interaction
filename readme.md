Moment of Interaction
=====================

n = regenerate world
y = confirm village start location
click = choose cell

=====================

Unfortunately the simulation isn't balanced yet and so the resources get out of control very fast.
The only constraint is grain levels. WHich keeps it at least sort of in check.

The game may crash unfortunately.

If world gen gets stuck on a blue world with grey dots, restart the game. That is a bug in world gen I didn't have time to fix.
